I wrote this code during summer 2012 when I only completed a few intro classes with Java as my first language. The code is a giant mess because I had to learn python, lists comprehensions, tuples, numpy, and opencv at the same time. I regret the design of this code.


This repo contains 4 files.

final.py is the main file that contains all the proper data extraction.

The three other files are just simple scripts made to help automate mundane tasks.


I wish knew about this technique.
